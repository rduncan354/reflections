What happens when you initialize a repository?  Why do you need to do it?

I believe initializing a repository puts it in a known start state.  We need to do this to know what state
the repository is in.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?   What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is the same directory but in a different state.  Actually I'm not 100% sure about this question.
